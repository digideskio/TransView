CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.8
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o meltPeaks() normalizes to Reads Per Million mapped reads after quality filtering according to the filtered_reads slot.
    o parseReads() now also returns the total and local base pairs covered which can be accessed by the slots gsize() and lsize() respectively.  


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.7
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o New convenience function meltPeaks(), which returns a data frame with normalized peak densities suitable for plotting with ggplot2. 
    
BUG FIXES

    o Minor help file corrections.
    

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.6
------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o macs2gr() supports relative distances instead of absolute distances reported by older MACS versions.
    

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.5
------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o annotatePeaks() did not accurately resolve ambiguities in some instances.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.4
------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o gtf2gr() can now handle gene and transcript IDs with white spaces.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.3
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o All slice methods can now return binned densities of predefined width.
    o The method to bin data can be specified by a new option in plotTV and the slice methods called bin_method. The amount of bins to be returned can be specified by nbins.
    o Default method to plot densities in plotTV is now mean instead of linear interpolation using approx. median or max are additional possibilities.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.2
------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Minor bug fix in plotTV
    

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.1
------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Minor bug fix in plotTVData


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.0
------------------------


NEW FEATURES

    o A new class TVResults is returned by plotTV containing all important results of the clustering and plotting.
    o TVResults objects can be accessed by their slots and plotTVData. plotTVData returns a data frame with the summarized results.
    o Added option showPlot to plotTV() to suppress plotting optionally. This is useful if only the clustering results are needed.
    o Added an option name_width to plotTV() to enable customized widths of the row labels.

BUG FIXES

    o Improved kmeans clustering


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.6
------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed an error which occurred if annotatePeaks was used with unifyBy.
    o sliceNT did not flip the exons on the negative strand in some situations.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.5
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o gtf2gr transcript_id and gene_id attribute names can now be customized.

BUG FIXES

    o annotatePeaks returned an error when remove_unmatched was disabled. 
    o Increased filter accuracy of annotatePeaks when min_genelength > 0.
    

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.4
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o All slice methods return NA instead of NULL in case of chromosome miss matches or negative query lengths. 
	
BUG FIXES

    o Using toRle in the slice methods will work with missing values. 


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.3
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Setting psize to 'preserve' will enable macs2gr to return the original peak lengths.
    o annotatePeaks can now preserve the gene_id column if present.
	
BUG FIXES

    o Improved type checking.
    
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.2
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added an option to gtf2gr which defines the GTF feature type entry to be filtered during parsing  
    o gtf2gr also incorporates the gene_id if present in the input gtf file
    
 
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.1
------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed a bug which resulted in wrong quality score cut off in parseReads()
    o annotatePeaks() did not accept input gtf files with present values
    

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.0
------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed a bug which resulted in wrong density maps of overlapping regions from sliceN

NEW FEATURES

    o Release version with several minor, mainly manual related improvements.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.3
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Renamed all C files. Registering now takes place in a separate file.
    
    o plotTV can now alternatively take a character vector of IDs matching 'transcript_id' in the gtf instead of a GRanges object. This is useful to plot RNA-Seq data matching without regions. 

BUG FIXES
   
    o Added PACKAGE argument to .call
    
    o readthrough_pairs argument to parseReads declared experimental.
	
    o Removed the matching RNA-Seq data set and added pasillaBamSubset as an example for RNA-Seq visualisation.
	

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.2
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added getter methods for all slots of DensityContainer and inherited classes for individual access. Added setter methods for spliced and ex_name
    
    o removed dc.size() and added the slot 'size' instead. Also added env and data_pointer slots to class DensityContainer
    
    o improved documentation of S4 methods with usage section
    
    o gtf2df and macs2df renamed to gtf2gr and macs2gr respectively. They are now returning a GRanges object.

    o annotatePeaks takes and returns only GRanges objects.
	
    o id2tss renamed to peak2tss and now returning an updated GRanges object 
	
    o plotTV accepts GRanges objects rather than data.frames for gtf and peaks input

BUG FIXES
   
    o Removed all direct slot accessions

    o Removed unnecessary call to dyn.load and dyn.unload in parseReads()
    

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.1
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o plotTV returns ordering to reproduce kmeans clustering

BUG FIXES

    o sliceNT did not flip the exons on the negative strand

    o Argument rowv to plotTV did not work with expression threshold remove_lowex 

    o Installation on 32bit Windows was not possible
